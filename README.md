# White Blood Cell Subtype Identification Using ResNet Architecture

Developed a deep learning model using a customized ResNet-50 architecture to automate the identification and classification of white blood cell (WBC) subtypes in microscopic blood smear images. This model aimed to reduce diagnostic errors and workload in clinical pathology by accurately detecting eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. Leveraged advanced CNN techniques like skip connections and residual blocks. Evaluated performance using a publicly available blood cell image dataset.
